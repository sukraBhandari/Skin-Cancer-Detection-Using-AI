## Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-AI


### Project Summary and motivation

   According to American Cancer Society, Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the US. 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70. When detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is 99 percent. Skin cancer is primarily diagnosed visually. Generally, the first step in diagnosis is initial clincal screening followed by biopsy and histopathological examination. 
   
   This project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program. The purpose of this project is to create a AI model to classify an image skin lesions into three different classes ie melonoma, nevus and seborrhic keratosis. I am using tranfer learning methods using VGG16 architecture for image classification.
